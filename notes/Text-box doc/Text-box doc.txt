The GarfieldRPG textbox system has plenty of functions for good ol' fun. Here's a guide on how to use em.
To call a message

	You must tie each individual message to an array
	Then use the text_box function with that array, to make the textbox appear.
	You must have a semicollon in front of the actual message
	
		text[0] = ";first message";
		text[1] = ";second message";
		text[2] = ";third message";
	
		text_box(text);
			
message activators!
	
	Portraits can be switched with #port_
	If it's the first message and no portrait is stated, it'll simply be blank
	If it's not the first message, and no portrait is stated, it'll use the previous message's portrait
	If you need a blank message in the middle of a conversation, use #port_none#
	
		text[0] = "#port_garfield_bored#	;Good morning Jon";
		text[1] = "#port_jon_sad# 			;Good morning Garfield";
		text[2] = "#port_none# 				;Despite their comments, it is actually a horrible morning";
		text_box(text);
		
	Switching fonts
	there is a default font, but it can be changed if neccesary with #f_
	
		text[0] = "#port_garfield_bored#						;What a boring day";
		text[1] = "#port_sans_undertale#	 #f_comic_sans#		;Hey";
		text[2] = "#port_garfield_annoyed#	 #f_action_man#		;wrong game pal";
		text_box(text);
		
	Still portrait
	by default the portraits will wave up and down. that can be changed with #still#
	
		text[0] = "#port_garfield_bored#			;My head is going up and down";
		text[1] = "#port_garfield_bored#   #still#	;But now it's all still";
		text_box(text);
		
	No sound
	self-explanatory #nosound#
	
	Custom sound
	by default the sound is indicated by the portrait name. That can be changed with #sound_
	Also. If the you follow the name with "_playonce" the sound won't loop, good for say Odie's bark noises
	
		text[0] = "#port_garfield_annoyed#	#nosound#				;Why is my voice all silent";
		text[1] = "#port_garfield_annoyed#	#sound_vo_jon#			;What the- now i have Jon's voice???";
		text[2] = "#port_odie_happy#		#sound_bark_playonce	;woof!";
		text_box(text);
		
	Execute
	Executes a script after the message is done
	#execute_[the script to execute]#
	
		text[0] = "#port_garfield_angry#	#execute_kick_odie_off_table#	;You Stupid mutt! You're going into orbit";
		text[1] = "#port_odie_surprise#		#sound_Odie_yelp_playonce#		;Owwww";
		text[2] = "#port_garfield_angry#									;You stay off the table!!!!";
		text_box(text);
	
	Choice (turns certain other activators off)
	The question text is written after the last ;
	A single choice is written like so:
	#choice_[index in array to go to, next] ; [script to execute, if any] ; [Choice text]#
	
		
		text[0] = "#port_jon#												;Garfield please get rid of the mouse!!!";
		text[1] = "#choice_2;mouseQuest_script;okay...#   #choice_3;;NO"#  ;Will you get rid of the mouse?"
		
		text[2] = "#port_jon_happy#	  #close#								;Oh thank you thank you thank you!!!";

		text[3] = "#port_jon_angry#											;You never do anything useful!!!";
		text_box(text);
	
Text effects

	Colored Text
	Can change the color of some letters
	Colors available: red blue green pink purple cyan yellow orange rainbow
	/c([the color to use]) to set the start of the color effect. And /c to stop the color effect again
	
		text[0] = "#port_jon_sad#		;I'm feeling really /c(blue)blue today...";
		text[1] = "#port_garfield_smug#	;Why not cook some /c(orange)lasagna/c to lift your spirits";
		text[2] = "#port_jon_angry#		;We need to eat more /c(green)greens/c in this house Garfield!";
		text[3] = "#port_garfield_smug#	;My diet consists of/c(rainbow) all the colors in the rainbow/c Jon";
		text_box(text);
